# Simple-Linear-Regression
Linear regression from scratch

I have shown the implementation of simple linear regression from scratch i.e without using any libraries so that the working of algorithm is clear to understand.

The dataset I have used in the project is called the “Auto Insurance in Sweden” dataset and involves predicting the total payment for all the claims in thousands of Swedish Kronor (y) given the total number of claims (x).

This means that for a new number of claims (x) we will be able to predict the total payment of claims (y).

You can find the dataset from this link :
